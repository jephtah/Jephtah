Hey there!

Nice to meet you â€” Iâ€™m Jephtah.

Iâ€™m a passionate software engineer with 7+ years of hands-on experience building scalable systems, distributed architectures, and solving complex technical problems. I thrive in fast-moving environments where learning never stops and where technology can be used to create meaningful, lasting impact.

My work spans distributed systems, backend engineering, product development, and applied machine learning. Iâ€™m deeply curious about how to design resilient, scalable, and autonomous systems that not only work, but thrive under real-world complexity.

What motivates me most is working on products and problems I care about â€” challenges that push me to grow and stretch the boundaries of what I know.

ðŸ”§ My toolbox keeps growing â€” currently working with:

Languages:
Java Â· TypeScript Â· Golang

Frameworks & Libraries:
React.js Â· React Native Â· Django Â· Express Â· Gin

DevOps & Infrastructure:
Docker Â· Kubernetes Â· TravisCI Â· CircleCI

Cloud Platforms:

Data & Messaging:

ðŸ“« Reach me anytime: uchejephtah@gmail.com

Always open to meaningful conversations, interesting collaborations, and new challenges.
